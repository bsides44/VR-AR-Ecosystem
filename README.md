A 3D systems-view map of the AR/VR Ecosystem of New Zealand.

The aim is to find new opportunities and points of conversion by visualising the active XR ecosystem of Aotearoa. 

Community collaboration is encouraged via the ability to add entities to the map. The form automatically updated the map by sending data to a Sheet, which then causes a hot reload on update.
